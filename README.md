This repo is for the work done for LNET paper. Other information about the paper is to be added soon.

The paper proposes a new metric for evaluting security application based on different applications requirements. The reopositery consists of building many machine learning models for UNSW dataset and our own healthcare testbed dataset and evaluating them based on traditional ML metrics and newly proposed metric. 

Paper file include the paper directory

Datasets file include the dataset to be used for machine learning 

Simulation is for virtualizations for different metrics (Fig. 1 in the paper)

Core file is for ML codes 

Details are to be added soon
